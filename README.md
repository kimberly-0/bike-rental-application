# Bike rental application

This project is a program to manage bicycle rentals. It enables the creation of road bikes and electric bikes, adding new bikes to the company's collection, renting out bikes, and terminating rental contracts. The program also keeps track of customer records and which customer has rented which bike with a maximum of 1 per customer [^1]. All customers can rent road bikes, but only 'Gold Class' customers that are at least 21 years old can rent electric bikes.
